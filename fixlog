-testbuilder.py: Name dictionary? It's frivolous but fun.

-datagathering.py: maybe just start the whole thing over, honestly

DONE:
-datagathering.py and testbuilder: incompatible columns/ col names
-testbuilder.py and friends: 'Cat.' is a bad name. change to 'Cat' or to 'Reason'
-datagathering.py: precancer numbers are 2,3,4. cancer numbers are 5,6. In the testbuilder, there are only 1,2 and 3.
